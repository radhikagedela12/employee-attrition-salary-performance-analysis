# employee-attrition-salary-performance-analysis
Statistical modeling and data analysis project investigating the interplay between employee attrition, salaries, and performance ratings using R. Includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and OLS modeling based on Kaggle HR dataset.



# Data-Driven Insights into Employee Attrition, Salaries, and Performance Ratings

## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on employee attrition, salary structure, and performance ratings. The study leverages statistical methods such as **multiple linear regression**, **logistic regression**, and **ordinary least squares regression** to uncover critical factors influencing organizational workforce trends.

## üìà Research Questions

1. **What factors influence employee salaries?**  
   ‚Üí Using multiple linear regression on job role, level, department, etc.

2. **Can we predict employee attrition based on demographics and job variables?**  
   ‚Üí Logistic regression using job level, percent salary hike, and job role.

3. **What impacts employee performance ratings?**  
   ‚Üí OLS regression based on satisfaction variables.
